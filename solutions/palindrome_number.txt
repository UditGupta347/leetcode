/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution reverses the integer and compares it with the original. It avoids converting the integer to a string by using modulus and division operations.
 * Time Complexity: O(log(x)) where x is the input number, as it processes each digit once.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.
