/*
Approach/Algorithm: The solution checks if an integer is a palindrome by reversing the number and comparing it with the original. This is done without converting the integer to a string.
Time Complexity: O(log10(n)) where n is the value of x, as we are processing each digit of the number.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
