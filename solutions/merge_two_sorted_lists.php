/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * The code attempts to merge two sorted linked lists but contains logical errors and syntax issues. It seems to intend to use a sum variable to merge lists, but the logic is incomplete and incorrect.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the total number of nodes in both lists, assuming the correct implementation of merging.
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only a few extra variables are used, assuming the correct implementation of merging.
