/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution attempts to merge two sorted linked lists by first checking if both lists are non-null. However, the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect as it only returns 0 if both lists are non-null and does nothing otherwise.
 * Time Complexity: O(1), as it only performs a single check.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.
