/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process. It iterates through both lists,
 * comparing the current nodes and adding the smaller node to the merged list.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as we are only using a few extra pointers regardless of input size.
