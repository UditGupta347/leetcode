/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution attempts to merge two sorted linked lists by first checking if both lists are non-null. However, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect as it does not handle the merging logic and returns 0 instead of a merged list.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1), due to the single conditional check and immediate return.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional space is used.
