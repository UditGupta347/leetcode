/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution uses a recursive approach to merge two sorted linked lists.
 * It compares the nodes of both lists and recursively merges the smaller node first.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of list1 and list2, respectively.
 * Space Complexity: O(n + m), due to the recursion stack space.
