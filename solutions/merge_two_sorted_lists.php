/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution uses a recursive approach to merge two sorted linked lists. It compares the values of the current nodes of both lists and recursively merges the rest of the lists.
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.
 * Space Complexity: O(n + m), due to the recursive call stack.
