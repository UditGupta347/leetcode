/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * Use a dummy node to simplify merging. Iterate through both lists,
 * comparing nodes and attaching the smaller node to the merged list.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of list1 and list2, respectively.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as we are only using a few extra pointers.
