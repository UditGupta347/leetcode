/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * This solution uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process. It iterates through both lists,
 * comparing the current nodes and attaching the smaller node to the merged list.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of list1 and list2, respectively.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as the merging is done in-place without using extra space.
