/*
Approach/Algorithm:
The solution checks if an integer is a palindrome by comparing the number with its reversed form.
It first handles edge cases (negative numbers and numbers ending in 0), then reverses the number and compares it to the original.

Time Complexity: O(log10(n)) where n is the value of x. This is because we are processing each digit of the number once.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
