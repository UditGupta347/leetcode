/*
  Approach/Algorithm:
  This solution attempts to check if the input integer n is a power of two by first checking if n is zero. However, the solution is incomplete and does not fully implement the required logic.

  Time Complexity: O(1), as it only performs a single comparison.
  Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.
