/*
 * Approach/Algorithm:
 * Iterate through the string, for each character, check if it forms a subtractive combination with the next character.
 * If it does, add the difference to the result and skip the next character. If it doesn't, add the value of the current character.
 * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), using a fixed amount of space for the mapping and variables.
